My research is on the interface between the theory and application of Statistics. I have worked on a wide range of statistical problems ranging over air pollution, anxiety and depression, astronomy, athletics, concrete, cosmetics, flooding, fungicides, fuel filters, marketing of cars, obesity and schizophrenia. I have also served as a consultant to industry on statistical issues. I worked in the Department of Statistics at the University of Michigan until 2006 when I moved to the University of Bath.
