The UK government asked OFQUAL (a semi-independent government body) to determine the A-level grades. OFQUAL developed an algorithm based on past school performance and teacher rankings of students explained here. When these results were released there was an uproar because large numbers of students did not receive the grades they were expecting and rejected from their chosen universities. After days of pressure the UK government backtracked on these predicted results and also allowed teacher predicted grades. For many universities, this has resulted in more students having qualified to enter than they can accommodate. Hence chaos.\nNaturally statisticians were very interested in this algorithm. Back at the beginning of the process, the Royal Statistical Society had volunteered professorial help in constructing the algorithm. But OFQUAL insisted on a highly restrictive NDA to which the RSS declined to agree. After details of the algorithm emerged, Guy Nason described several deficiencies in the algorithm. The algorithm had some biases that favoured small independent schools (that usually have wealthier students) and tended to mark down larger state schools (that usually have less privileged students). My colleague in Computer Science at Bath, Tom Haines, describes other problems with the construction of the algorithm (although I do take umbrage at him blaming statisticians for this! – we did try to help)\nStatisticians have suggested improvements to the algorithm that would avoid some of the bias problems but given the information available, students would still have been upset at the result. Given that the school of the student was one of the few useful predictors available, one could not avoid using this information and yet the very fact that this was done was found highly objectionable by many. Why should the school you attend determine your university outcome? Furthermore, due to a natural phenomenom known as “regression to the mean”, predictions for students who had good reasons to expect to do well will be shifted downwards. Even had OFQUAL taken more professional advice, many students would still have been angry about the results and the media uproar would have been much the same.\nI propose that an entirely different approach should have been used. Few really care what A-level grades they get – they care which university will accept them. We can issue a pandemic certificate of completion for the A-levels and deal with the university admission problem directly. Here’s my proposal:\n Wait until all universities have made their offers and students have made their firm (first) choice and insurance (second) choice. Oxbridge is at the top of the tree. They randomly choose students from among those they have accepted. They would want to control numbers on different courses and in different colleges but they must make a random selection. They pass on their rejected students to the next tier of universities. As in a normal year, the next tier of universities would wait until they receive their insurance students students from Oxbridge. This year they will accept all the insurance students and randomly fill their remaining places with students who held them as first choice. They pass on their rejected students to the next tier as in a normal year. The process repeats until all students have been (randomly) allocated. The sequence of universities in the decision process is determined by the entry tariff for the given subject as would happen in a normal year. The only differences are that the selection is random and all insurance students are accepted.  Now there would be need to be some modifications occasionally if capacity constraints are hit or for other uncommon circumstances. Given that there is about enough capacity in the university system as a whole for all students, my proposed algorithm would ensure that almost all students receive their first or second choice of university. Now doubtless there would be some sad face photos of students whose hopes and dreams have been crushed by not going to their first choice of university and having to suffer through the horrors of their second choice. But the important difference is that their misfortune will be just that – bad luck and cannot be attributed to some perceived bias against them. You can’t get angry at bad luck.\nEfficiency is the other consideration as we want to allocate students to universities commensurate with their ability. Under my scheme, students chose universities where they believed they could gain admission and universities had accepted them. Given we have no A-level exam information, this is the best we can do.\nUnfortunately, it’s too late to execute this scheme as it would be politically unacceptable that already accepted students could now be rejected.\n","date":1597795200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598624921,"objectID":"c0b1e01fbd6a5b5c4ab86c2f57c0a0c6","permalink":"/post/an-alternative-to-the-ofqual-algorithm/","publishdate":"2020-08-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/an-alternative-to-the-ofqual-algorithm/","section":"post","summary":"As anyone in the UK knows, A-level exams, taken at age 18 and mostly used to determined admission to university were cancelled this year due to the pandemic.

The internet reaches everywhere but what may be adequate for light use by a single user quickly crumbles when large numbers try to make downloads simultaneously. We anticipated this would be a problem and came equipped with R and Rstudio on many cheap memory sticks but this is not sufficient. For example, try installing the Tidyverse and knitting an R markdown document. You will find this requires installing several packages with multiple dependencies. You’ve probably forgotten the multiple packages, pieces of software and configurations you did to make things work on your own machine. It was all so easy when you had a good internet connection. Find an old laptop with a fresh OS install and disconnect it from the internet. Discover what it takes to get it running on your R teaching materials and then you’ll be prepared. Purchase a local data SIM for that country so you can create a local WiFi hotspot. At least you’ll have a chance to access the internet in case of need (quite likely!). Also plan on a period of chaos at the beginning of the workshop to take care of the many install problems. Tidyverse. R is difficult, particularly for users only familiar with GUI-based statistics software. A tidyverse-only approach greatly simplifies the range of syntax and commands that the workshop participants will need to understand. You can create exercises that they can successfully complete. The tidyverse is sufficiently powerful that you can perform a wide range of practically useful tasks. The participants will gain a feeling of accomplishment and some ability to use R for their own work. Soon enough they will also need to learn to use base R. But if you start with base R, the entry cost is much higher and some of your students will not make it. Simplicity. This comes in two forms. Firstly, in countries where English is not the native language, you will find that most professional people (who are attending your workshop) know at least some English but that does not mean all of them are entirely fluent. In your presentation, speak slowly and enunciate your words clearly. Avoid colloquial expressions and figures of speech. Do not use complex words. As a native speaker of English, you will find this difficult. Use written documentation to supplement your spoken presentation. Consider using a translator. Secondly, consider simplicity in your R presentation. It is tempting to include some cool R tricks but beginners won’t enjoy this. Stick to the basics and reduce complexity where possible. Local Data. All too many expositions of R use overworn example datasets such as mtcars. Find some datasets from the country of the workshop.

We focus on a set of 117 near-natural “benchmark” catchments to detect trends not driven by land use and other human impacts, and aim to attribute trends in peak river flows to some climate indices such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the East Atlantic (EA) index. We propose modelling all stations together in a Bayesian multilevel framework to be better able to detect any signal that is present in the data by pooling information across several stations. This approach leads to the detection of a clear countrywide time trend. Additionally, in a univariate approach, both the EA and NAO indices appear to have a considerable association with peak river flows. When a multivariate approach is taken to unmask the collinearity between climate indices and time, the association between NAO and peak flows disappears, while the association with EA remains clear. This demonstrates the usefulness of a multivariate and multilevel approach when it comes to accurately attributing trends in peak river flows.","tags":null,"title":"Attribution of long-term changes in peak river flows in Great Britain","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Academic  Academic | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click  PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

The code is available as Jupyter Notebooks.\nI was able to translate most of the content into Python. Sometimes the output is similar but not the same. Python has far less statistics functionality than R but it seems most of the functionality in base R can be found in Python. R now has over 10,000 packages. Python has about ten times as many but most of these are unrelated to Statistics. My book does not depend heavily on additional packages so this was not so much of an obstacle for me. In a few cases, I rely on R packages that do not exist in Python. Doubtless a Python equivalent could be created but that will take some effort.\nAfter this experience, I can say that R is a better choice for Statistics than Python. Nevertheless, there are good reasons why one might choose to do Statistics with Python. One obvious reason is that if you already know Python, you will be reluctant to also learn R. In the UK, Python is now being taught in schools and we will soon have a wave of students who will come to university knowing Python. Python usage is also more common in several areas such as Computer Science and Engineering. Another reason to use Python is the huge range of packages ranging from text, image and signal processing to machine learning and optimisation. These go far beyond what can found in R. The Python userbase is much larger than R and this has translated into greater functionality as a programming language.\nI started using S in 1984 and moved onto R when it was first released. It’s hard to move from 34 years of experience of R to no prior experience with Python. Here are a few impressions that may help other R users who start learning Python:\n1.Base R is quite functional without loading any packages. In Python, you will always need to load some packages even to do some basic computations. You will probably need to load numpy, scipy, pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib just to get something similar to the base R environment. 2. Python is very fussy about namespaces. You will find yourself have to prefix every loaded function. For example, you cannot write log(x) — you’ll need to write np.log(x) indicating that log comes from the numpy package. I understand the reason for this but this alone makes Python code longer than R code. 3. Python array indices start from zero. Again, I know why this is but it’s something the R user has to continually adjust to. 4. matplotlib is the Python equivalent of the R base plotting functionality. It does more than R but a range of options is daunting for the new user. I had a better time with seaborn which is more like ggplot is producing attractive plots. (There’s a partial translation of ggplot into Python but I preferred seaborn). 5. statsmodels provides the linear modelling functionality found in R but you will find some differences that will trip you up. In particular, no intercept term is included by default and the handling of saturated models is different, as the Moore-Penrose inverse is used rather than dropping some offending columns as R does. The output from the linear model is far too verbose for my tastes. Of course, you can work around all these issues. 6. Python uses pipes very commonly. It helps if you have already started using these in R via the %\u0026gt;% operator to get you into that frame of mind.\nNew users inevitably encounter some frustrations but did find Python enjoyable. I have nightmares about having to do Statistics in Excel but Python world is a pleasant land even if it is still a bit unfamiliar to me.\n","date":1524787200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524787200,"objectID":"e4230bc9aba8dace05be5d0c1fb99fd6","permalink":"/post/linear-models-with-r-translated-to-python/","publishdate":"2018-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/linear-models-with-r-translated-to-python/","section":"post","summary":"I have translated the R code in Linear Models with R into Python.

I even wrote such a book myself. But is the GLM paradigm really that useful?\nThe idea is that we can develop a general theory of estimation, inference and diagnostics that will apply to a wide class of models. We will avoid duplication of effort and synergies will arise across this class of models. The idea goes back to a 1972 paper in JRSS-B by Nelder and Wedderburn.\nBut what response distributions belong to the GLM family? The Gaussian (or normal) distribution is the most used in practice. But this is simply the linear model for which much more general and powerful results exist. The Gaussian gains nothing from the GLM perspective.\nNext we have the binomial and Poisson, which do benefit from GLM membership. But beyond that, the family members become progressively more exotic. The gamma GLM is not commonly used because a linear model with a transformed response will often suffice. Venturing further into the outback, you may find an inverse Gaussian or Tweedie GLM but these are truly rare birds. There are more interesting distributions such as the negative binomial and beta but they are excluded from the club as they don’t belong to the “exponential family” of distributions.\nSo there are only two important members of the GLM family: the binomial and the Poisson. Even here we must be careful because large chunks of the theory and practice for these models is specific to one or the other. The GLM paradigm does tell us one way to estimate and do inference for these models. But there other ways to do these things.\nStatisticians love widely applicable theories – but perhaps a little too much. GLM is a nice, useful theory but the paradigm has become too dominant in the way people learn or are taught about these kind of models.\n","date":1439942400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1439942400,"objectID":"7a6916cbe4a8e9c934fd78b165d0920a","permalink":"/post/glm/","publishdate":"2015-08-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/glm/","section":"post","summary":"There are a very large number of books, articles and university courses with “Generalised Linear Models” (GLM) in the title.
