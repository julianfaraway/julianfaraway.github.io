      <description>Consider a regression dataset with a response and several predictors. You want a single plot showing the response plotted against each of the predictors. You could use the pairs() but that also shows plots between the predictors. If there are more than a few predictors, there are too many plots to see any one of them clearly. Here’s a simple solution:
Here’s an example dataset:
